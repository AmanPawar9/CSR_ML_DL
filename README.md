*Description*
*The above link contains the results of strain-controlled cyclic triaxial and cyclic direct simple shear tests performed on Ottawa F65 sand. The datasets for triaxial tests are published as a separate experiment. The cyclic direct simple shear tests are also presented in two separate datasets: one for specimens subjected to uniform shear stress waves and the second one for specimens subjected to non-uniform shear stress waves.

*Please refer to the provided links for more information and to access the datasets.*
